Dear Juliana,<br>
If you can, do come before midnight, <br>
right by the treasury's side. <br>
I apologize for the bother I'm bringing, cause of this <br>
unnecessary feelings I must share. <br>
I've longed to speak my heart, to share my feelings, <br>
<br>
To look into your eyes, and confess it all to you <br>
<br>
Your one and only, N <br>
</p>
