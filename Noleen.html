Meet Noleen, she was born on March 1,2007. She's known as a shy and introverted child. But, it's not like she chose to be that way. She often felt overlooked and ignored by her peers. No matter how hard she tried to fit in or be noticed, she felt like she was invisible in other people's eyes.
<br>
One day, Noleen stumbled upon a group of people gossiping. She found herself drawn to the drama and intrigue of the conversation, and for the first time in a long time, she felt like she was a part of something. From that moment on, Noleen embraced gossiping as a way to feel seen and heard. She became known as the go-to person for the latest gossip, and she enjoys attention and interest she received from others.
